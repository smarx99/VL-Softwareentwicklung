## HW1

| Exercise  | Points    |

| 2         | 3.5/3.5   |

| **Total** | 10.0/10.0 |

- Exercise 2: You did more than you needed to, but that is perfectly fine.
- Exercise 3: Minor problem: you duplicated the attributes of the super class. However, super class attributes are always placed on the same index if they are inherited, like it is the case in this example. ONLY hidden attributes (redefined in the subclass) are "duplicated".
