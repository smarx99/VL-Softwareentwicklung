The code is developed in the composite pattern. The Component is an interface which declares common methods. 
In this case the PlayerComponent Class serves as the Component.
A leaf is an implementation of a component. These leafs do not have any children.
In the given code the classes PlayerArm, PlayerHead and PlayerLeg are the leafs. The methods add and remove are empty in those classes.
A composite is also an implementation of a component. However, it contains a list of leafs or other composites, thus, has children.
In our case, PlayerBody and Player are composites.
